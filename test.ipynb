The people of India have reposed their faith in the government led by \\nthe Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and re-elected it for a historic \\nthird term under his leadership. We are grateful for their support, faith and \\ntrust in our policies. We are determined to ensure that all Indians, regardless \\nof religion, caste, gender and age, make substantial progress in realising their \\nlife goals and aspirations. \\nGlobal Context \\n2. The global economy, while performing better than expected, is still in \\nthe grip of policy uncertainties. Elevated asset prices, political uncertainties \\nand shipping disruptions continue to pose significant downside risks for \\ngrowth and upside risks to inflation.  \\n3. In this context, India’s economic growth  continues  to be the shining \\nexception and will remain so in the years ahead. India’s inflation continues to \\nbe low, stable and moving towards the 4 per cent target. Core inflation (non-\\nfood, non -fuel) currently is 3.1 per cent. Steps are being taken to ensure \\nsupplies of perishable goods reach market adequately. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\budget_speech.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content=' 2  \\n \\nInterim Budget \\n4. As mentioned in the interim budget, we need to focus on 4 major \\ncastes, namely  ‘Garib’ (Poor), ‘Mahilayen’ (Women), ‘Yuva’ (Youth) and  \\n‘Annadata’ (Farmer). For Annadata, we announced higher Minimum Support \\nPrices a month ago for all major crops, delivering on the promise of at least a \\n50 per cent margin over costs. Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana was \\nextended for five years, benefitting more than 80 crore people.  \\n5. Administrative actio ns for approval and implementation of various \\nschemes announced in the interim budget are well underway. The required \\nallocations have been made.   \\nBudget Theme \\n6. Turning attention to the full year and beyond, in this budget, we \\nparticularly focus on employment, skilling, MSMEs, and the middle class. I am \\nhappy to announce the Prime Minister’s package of 5 schemes and initiatives \\nto facilitate employment, skilling and other opportunities for 4.1 crore youth \\nover a 5-year period with a central outlay of ` 2 lakh crore.  I will speak about \\nthem shortly, while more details may be seen in the annexure.  This year, I \\nhave made a provision of ` 1.48 lakh crore for education, employment and \\nskilling.     \\nBudget Priorities \\n7. The people have given a unique opportunity to  our government to \\ntake the country on the path of strong development and all-round prosperity. \\nIn the interim budget, we promised to present a detailed roadmap for our \\npursuit of ‘ Viksit Bharat’. In line with the strategy set out in the interim \\nbudget, this budget envisages sustained efforts on the following 9 priorities \\nfor generating ample opportunities for all.   \\n1) Productivity and resilience in Agriculture \\n2) Employment & Skilling \\n3) Inclusive Human Resource Development and Social Justice \\n4) Manufacturing & Services \\n5) Urban Development    \\n6) Energy Security \\n7) Infrastructure '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\budget_speech.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content=' 3  \\n \\n8) Innovation, Research & Development and \\n9) Next Generation Reforms \\n8. Subsequent budgets will build on these, and add more priorities and \\nactions. A more detailed formulation will be carried out as part  of the \\n‘economic policy framework’ about which I will speak later in this speech.   \\n9. This budget details some of the specific actions to be initiated in the \\ncurrent year towards fulfilment of these priorities with potential for \\ntransformative changes.  The  budget also covers some of the previously \\nmade announcements with an intent to strengthen them and step up their \\nimplementation for expediting our journey towards the goal of Viksit Bharat.   \\nPriority 1: Productivity and resilience in Agriculture \\nTransforming agriculture research \\n10. Our government will undertake a comprehensive review of the \\nagriculture research setup to bring the focus on raising productivity and \\ndeveloping climate resilient varieties.  Funding will be provided in challenge \\nmode, including to the private sector. Domain experts both from the \\ngovernment and outside will oversee the conduct of such research.   \\nRelease of new varieties \\n11. New 109 high -yielding and climate -resilient varieties of 32 field and \\nhorticulture crops will be released for cultivation by farmers.  \\nNatural Farming \\n12. In the next two years, 1 crore farmers across the country will be \\ninitiated into natural farming supported by certification and branding. \\nImplementation will be through scientific institutions and willing gram \\npanchayats. 10,000 need -based bio -input resource centres will be \\nestablished.   \\nMissions for pulses and oilseeds  \\n13. For achieving self -sufficiency in pulses and oilseeds, we will \\nstrengthen their production, storage and marketing. As announced in the \\ninterim budget, a strategy is being put in place to achieve ‘atmanirbharta’ for \\noil seeds such as mustard, groundnut, sesame, soybean, and sunflower.   '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\budget_speech.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content=' 4  \\n \\nVegetable production & Supply Chains \\n14. Large scale clusters for vegetable production will be developed closer \\nto major consumption centres. We will promote Farmer- Producer \\nOrganizations, cooperatives and start -ups for vegetable  supply chains \\nincluding for collection, storage, and marketing. \\nDigital Public Infrastructure for Agriculture \\n15. Buoyed by the success of the pilot project, our government, in \\npartnership with the states, will facilitate the implementation of the Digital \\nPublic Infrastructure  (DPI) in agriculture for coverage of farmers and their \\nlands in 3 years. During this year, digital crop survey for Kharif using the DPI \\nwill be taken up in 400 districts. The details of 6 crore farmers and their lands \\nwill be brought into the farmer and land registries. Further, the issuance of \\nJan Samarth based Kisan Credit Cards will be enabled in 5 states. \\nShrimp Production & Export \\n16. Financial support for setting up a network of Nucleus Breeding \\nCentres for Shrimp Brood stocks will be pr ovided. Financing for shrimp \\nfarming, processing and export will be facilitated through NABARD.   \\nNational Cooperation Policy \\n17. Our government will bring out a National Cooperation Policy for \\nsystematic, orderly and all- round development of the cooperative s ector. \\nFast-tracking growth of rural economy and generation of employment \\nopportunities on a large scale will be the policy goal. \\n18. This year, I have made a provision of ` 1.52 lakh crore for agriculture \\nand allied sector.     \\nPriority 2: Employment & Skilling \\nEmployment Linked Incentive \\n19. Our government will implement following 3 schemes for ‘Employment \\nLinked Incentive’, as part of the Prime Minister’s package. These will be \\nbased on enrolment in the EPFO, and focus on recognition of first-time \\nemployees, and support to employees and employers.     \\n '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\budget_speech.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content=' 5  \\n \\nScheme A: First Timers  \\n20. This scheme will provide one -month wage to all persons newly \\nentering the workforce in all formal sectors. The direct benefit transfer of \\none-month salary in 3 instalments to first -time employees, as registered in \\nthe EPFO, will be up to ` 15,000. The eligibility limit will be a salary of  \\n` 1 lakh per month. The scheme is expected to benefit 210 lakh youth.  \\nScheme B: Job Creation in manufacturing  \\n21. This scheme will incentivize additional employment in the \\nmanufacturing sector, linked to the employment of first- time employees. An \\nincentive will be provided at specified scale directly both to the employee \\nand the employer with respect to their EPFO contribution in the first 4 years \\nof employment. The scheme is expected to benefit 30 lakh youth entering \\nemployment, and their employers.  \\nScheme C: Support to employers  \\n22. This employer- focussed scheme will cover additional employment in \\nall sectors. All addi tional employment within a salary of ` 1 lakh per month \\nwill be counted. The government will reimburse to employers up to ` 3,000 \\nper month for 2 years towards their EPFO contribution for each additional \\nemployee. The scheme is expected to incentivize addi tional employment of \\n50 lakh persons.    \\nParticipation of women in the workforce  \\n23. We will facilitate higher participation of women in the workforce \\nthrough setting up of working women hostels in collaboration with industry, \\nand establishing creches. In addition, the partnership will seek to organize \\nwomen-specific skilling programmes, and promotion of market access for \\nwomen SHG enterprises. \\nSkilling programme  \\n24. I am happy to announce a new centrally sponsored scheme, as the 4 th \\nscheme under the Prime Minister’s package, for skilling in collaboration with \\nstate governments and Industry. 20 lakh youth will be skilled over a 5 -year \\nperiod. 1,000 Industrial Training Institutes will be upgraded in hub and spoke \\narrangements with outcome orientation.  Course co ntent and design will be '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\budget_speech.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content=' 6  \\n \\naligned to the skill needs of industry, and new courses will be introduced for \\nemerging needs. \\nSkilling Loans \\n25. The Model Skill Loan Scheme will be revised to facilitate loans up to  \\n` 7.5 lakh with a guarantee from a government promoted Fund. This measure \\nis expected to help 25,000 students every year. \\nEducation Loans \\n26. For helping our youth who have not been eligible for any benefit \\nunder government schemes and policies, I am happy to announce a financial \\nsupport for loans upto ` 10 lakh for higher education in domestic institutions. \\nE-vouchers for this purpose will be given directly to 1 lakh students every \\nyear for annual interest subvention of 3 per cent of the loan amount.   \\nPriority 3: Inclusive Human Resource Development and Social Justice \\nSaturation approach  \\n27. Our government is committed to all- round, all- pervasive and all-\\ninclusive development of people, particularly, farmers, youth, women and \\npoor. For achieving social justice comprehensively, the saturation approach \\nof covering  all eligible people through various programmes including those \\nfor education and health will be adopted to empower them by improving \\ntheir capabilities.  \\n28. Implementation of schemes meant for supporting economic activities \\nby craftsmen, artisans, self -help groups, scheduled caste, schedule tribe and \\nwomen entrepreneurs, and street vendors, such as PM Vishwakarma, PM \\nSVANidhi,  National Livelihood Missions, and Stand- Up India will be stepped \\nup. \\nPurvodaya \\n29. The states in the Eastern part of the country are rich in endowments \\nand have strong cultural traditions. We will formulate a plan, Purvodaya, for \\nthe all -round development of the eastern region of the country covering \\nBihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh.  This will cover '),\n",

On the Amritsar Kolkata Industrial Corridor, we will support \\ndevelopment of an industrial node at Gaya. This corridor will catalyze \\nindustrial development of the eastern region. The industrial node at Gaya will \\nalso be a good model for developing our ancient centres of cultural \\nimportance into future centres of modern economy. This model shall \\nshowcase “Vikas bhi Virasat bhi” in our growth trajectory.  \\n31. We will also support development of road connectivity projects, \\nnamely (1) Patna- Purnea Expressway, (2) Buxar -Bhagalpur Expressway, (3) \\nBodhgaya, Rajgir, Vaishali and Darbhanga spurs, and (4) additional 2 -lane \\nbridge over river G anga at Buxar at a total cost of ` 26,000 crore. Power \\nprojects, including setting up of a new 2400 MW power plant at Pirpainti, will \\nbe taken up at a cost of ` 21,400 crore.  New airports, medical colleges and \\nsports infrastructure in Bihar will be constructed.   \\n32. An additional allocation to support capital investments will be \\nprovided. The requests of Bihar Government for external assistance from \\nmultilateral development banks will be expedited.  \\nAndhra Pradesh Reorganization Act \\n33. Our government has made co ncerted efforts to fulfil the \\ncommitments in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act.  Recognizing the \\nstate’s need for a capital, we will facilitate special financial support through \\nmultilateral development agencies. In the current financial year ` 15,000 \\ncrore will be arranged, with additional amounts in future years.  \\n34. Our government is fully committed to financing and early completion \\nof the Polavaram Irrigation Project, which is the lifeline for Andhra Pradesh \\nand its farmers. This will facilitate our country’s food security as well.   \\n35. Under the Act, for promoting industrial development, funds will be \\nprovided for essential infrastructure such as water, power, railways and \\nroads in Kopparthy node on the Vishakhapatnam -Chennai Industrial Corridor \\nand Orvakal node on Hyderabad-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor.  An additional \\nallocation will be provided this year towards capital investment for economic \\ngrowth.   '),\n",

Grants for backward regions of Rayalaseema, Prakasam and North \\nCoastal Andhra, as stated in the Act, will also be provided. \\nPM Awas Yojana \\n37. Three crore additional houses under the PM Awas Yojana in rural and \\nurban areas in the country have been announced, for which the necessary \\nallocations are being made.   \\nWomen-led development \\n38. For promoting women -led development, the budget carries an \\nallocation of more than ` 3 lakh crore for schemes benefitting women and \\ngirls. This signals our government’s commitment for enhancing women’s role \\nin economic development.   \\nPradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan  \\n39. For improving the socio-economic condition of tribal communities, we \\nwill launch the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan by adopting \\nsaturation coverage for tribal families in tribal-majority villages and \\naspirational districts. This will cover 63,000 villages benefitting 5 crore tribal \\npeople.  \\nBank branches in North-Eastern Region \\n40. More than 100 branches of India Post Payment Bank will be set up in \\nthe North East region to expand the banking services.  \\n41. This year, I have made a provision of ` 2.66 lakh crore for rural \\ndevelopment including rural infrastructure.     \\nPriority 4: Manufacturing & Services \\nSupport for promotion of MSMEs \\n42.  This budget provides special attention to MSMEs and manufacturing, \\nparticularly labour- intensive manufacturing. We have formulated a package \\ncovering financing, regulatory changes and technology support for MSMEs to \\nhelp them grow and also compete globally, as mentioned in the interim \\nbudget. I am happy to announce the following specific measures.   \\n '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\budget_speech.pdf', 'page': 12}, page_content=' 9  \\n \\nCredit Guarantee Scheme for MSMEs in the Manufacturing Sector \\n43. For facilitating term loans to MSMEs for purchase of machinery and \\nequipment without collateral or third- party guarantee, a credit guarantee \\nscheme will be introduced. The scheme will operate o n pooling of credit risks \\nof such MSMEs. A separately constituted self -financing guarantee fund will \\nprovide, to each applicant, guarantee cover up to ` 100 crore, while the loan \\namount may be larger. The borrower will have to provide an upfront \\nguarantee fee and an annual guarantee fee on the reducing loan balance.  \\nNew assessment model for MSME credit \\n44. Public sector banks will build their in -house capabi lity to assess \\nMSMEs for credit, instead of relying on external assessment. They will also \\ntake a lead in developing or getting developed a new credit assessment \\nmodel, based on the scoring of digital footprints of MSMEs in the economy. \\nThis is expected to  be a significant improvement over the traditional \\nassessment of credit eligibility based only on asset or turnover criteria. That \\nwill also cover MSMEs without a formal accounting system. \\nCredit Support to MSMEs during Stress Period \\n45. I am happy to announce  a new mechanism for facilitating \\ncontinuation of bank credit to MSMEs during their stress period. While being \\nin the ‘special mention account’ (SMA) stage for reasons beyond their \\ncontrol, MSMEs need credit to continue their business and to avoid getting \\ninto the NPA stage. Credit availability will be supported through a guarantee \\nfrom a government promoted fund.   \\nMudra Loans \\n46. The limit of Mudra loans will be enhanced to ₹ 20 lakh from the \\ncurrent ₹ 10 lakh for those entrepreneurs who have availed and successfully \\nrepaid previous loans under the ‘Tarun’ category. \\nEnhanced scope for mandatory onboarding in TReDS \\n47. For facilitating MSMEs to unlock their working capital by converting \\ntheir trade receivables into cash, I propose to reduce the turnover thresho ld \\nof buyers for mandatory onboarding on the TReDS platform from ` 500 crore \\nto ` 250 crore. This measure will bring 22 more CPSEs and 7000 more '),\n",

Medium enterprises will also be included in \\nthe scope of the suppliers. \\nSIDBI branches in MSME clusters \\n48. SIDBI will open new branches to expand its reach to serve all major \\nMSME clusters within 3 years, and provide direct credit to them. With the \\nopening of 24 such branches this year, the service coverage will expand to \\n168 out of 242 major clusters.   \\nMSME Units for Food Irradiation, Quality & Safety Testing  \\n49. Financial support for setting up of 50 multi -product food irradiation \\nunits in the MSME sector will be provided.  Setting up of 100 food quality and \\nsafety testing labs with NABL accreditation will be facilitated.  \\nE-Commerce Export Hubs \\n50. To enable MSMEs and traditional artisans to sell their products in \\ninternational markets, E -Commerce Export Hubs will be set up in public -\\nprivate-partnership (PPP) mode . These hubs, under a seamless  regulatory \\nand logistic framework, will facilitate trade and export related services under \\none roof.  \\nMeasures for promotion of Manufacturing & Services  \\nInternship in Top Companies \\n51. As the 5 th scheme under the Prime Minister’s package, our \\ngovernment will  launch a comprehensive scheme for providing internship \\nopportunities in 500 top companies to 1 crore youth in 5 years. They will gain \\nexposure for 12 months to real -life business environment, varied professions \\nand employment opportunities. An internship allowance of ` 5,000 per \\nmonth along with a one -time assistance of ` 6,000 will be provided. \\nCompanies will be expected to bear the training cost and 10 per cent of the \\ninternship cost from their CSR funds.     \\nIndustrial Parks \\n52. Our government will facilitate development of investment- ready \\n“plug and play” industrial parks with complete infrastructure in or near 100 '),\n",

Twelve industrial parks under the National I ndustrial Corridor \\nDevelopment Programme also will be sanctioned. \\nRental Housing \\n54. Rental housing with dormitory type accommodation for industrial \\nworkers will be facilitated in PPP mode with VGF support and commitment \\nfrom anchor industries.  \\nShipping industry  \\n55.  Ownership, leasing and flagging reforms will be implemented to \\nimprove the share of the Indian shipping industry and generate more \\nemployment.  \\nCritical Mineral Mission \\n56. We will set up a Critical Mineral Mission for domestic production, \\nrecycling of critical minerals, and overseas acquisition of critical mineral \\nassets. Its mandate will include technology development, skilled workforce, \\nextended producer responsibility framework, and a suitable financing \\nmechanism. \\nOffshore mining of minerals \\n57. Our gove rnment will launch the auction of the first tranche of \\noffshore blocks for mining, building on the exploration already carried out.   \\nDigital Public Infrastructure Applications \\n58. Turning to the services sector, I propose development of DPI \\napplications at po pulation scale for productivity gains, business \\nopportunities, and innovation by the private sector. These are planned in the \\nareas of credit, e -commerce, education, health, law and justice, logistics, \\nMSME, services delivery, and urban governance.  \\nIntegrated Technology Platform for IBC eco-system \\n59.

The services of the Centre for Processing Accelerated Corporate Exit \\n(C-PACE) will be extended for voluntary closure of LLPs to reduce the closure \\ntime.  \\nNational Company Law Tribunals  \\n61. The IBC has resolved more than 1,000 companies, resulting in direct \\nrecovery of over ` 3.3 lakh crore to creditors. In addition,  28,000 cases \\ninvolving over ` 10 lakh crore have been disposed of, even prior to \\nadmission.  \\n62. Appropriate changes to the IBC, reforms and strengthening of the \\ntribunal and appellate tribunals will be initiated to speed up insolvency \\nresolution. Additional tribunals will be established. Out of those, some will be \\nnotified to decide cases exclusively under the Companies Act.   \\nDebt Recovery \\n63. Steps for reforming and strengthening debt recovery tribunals will be \\ntaken. Additional tribunals will be established to speed up recovery. \\nPriority 5: Urban Development  \\nCities as Growth Hubs \\n64. Working with  states , our government will facilitate development of \\n‘Cities as Growth Hubs’. This will be achieved through economic and transit \\nplanning, and orderly development of peri-urban areas utilising town \\nplanning schemes.  \\nCreative redevelopment of cities \\n65. For creativ e brownfield redevelopment of existing cities with a \\ntransformative impact, our government will formulate a framework for \\nenabling policies, market-based mechanisms and regulation.  \\n \\n '),\n",

This will include the central assistance of  ₹ 2.2 lakh crore \\nin the next 5 years.  A provision of interest subsidy to facilitate loans at \\naffordable rates is also envisaged.  \\n68. In addition, enabling policies and regulations for efficient and \\ntransparent rental housing markets with enhanced availability will also be put \\nin place.  \\nWater Supply and Sanitation  \\n69. In partnership with the State Governments and Multilateral \\nDevelopment Banks we will promote water supply, sewage treatment and \\nsolid waste management projects and services for 100 large cities through \\nbankable projects. These projects will also envisage use of treated water for \\nirrigation and filling up of tanks in nearby areas.    \\nStreet Markets \\n70. Building on the success of PM SVANidhi Scheme in transforming the \\nlives of street vendors, our Government envisions a scheme to support each \\nyear, over the next five years, the development of 100 weekly ‘haats’ or \\nstreet food hubs in select cities.  \\nStamp Duty \\n71. We will encourage states which continue to charge high stamp duty to \\nmoderate the rates for all, and also consider further lowering duties for \\nproperties purchased by women. This reform will be made an essential \\ncomponent of urban development schemes.  '),\n",

We will bring out a policy \\ndocument on appropriate energy transition pathways that balances the \\nimperatives of employment, growth and environmental sustainability.   \\nPM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana \\n73. In line with the announcement in the interim budget, PM Surya Ghar \\nMuft Bijli Yojana has been launched to install rooftop solar plants to enable 1 \\ncrore households obtain free electricity up to 300 units every month. The \\nscheme has generated remarkable res ponse with more than 1.28 crore \\nregistrations and 14 lakh applications, and we will further encourage it.   \\nPumped Storage Policy \\n74. A policy for promoting pumped storage projects will be brought out \\nfor electricity storage and facilitating smooth integration  of the growing \\nshare of renewable energy with its variable & intermittent nature in the \\noverall energy mix.  \\nResearch and development of small and modular nuclear reactors \\n75. Nuclear energy is expected to form a very significant part of the \\nenergy mix for Viksit Bharat. Towards that pursuit, our government will \\npartner with the private sector for (1) setting up Bharat Small Reactors, (2) \\nresearch & development of Bharat Small Modular Reactor, and (3) research & \\ndevelopment of newer technologies for nuclear energy. The R&D funding  \\nannounced in the interim budget will be made available for this sector.   \\nAdvanced Ultra Super Critical Thermal Power Plants  \\n76. The development of indigenous technology for Advanced Ultra Super \\nCritical (AUSC) thermal power plants with  much higher efficiency has been \\ncompleted. A joint venture between NTPC and BHEL will set up a full scale \\n800 MW commercial plant using AUSC technology. The government will \\nprovide the required fiscal support. Moving forward, development of \\nindigenous capacity for the production of high- grade steel and other '),\n",

A roadmap for moving the ‘hard to abate’ industries from ‘energy \\nefficiency’ targets to ‘emission targets’ will be formulated. Appropriate \\nregulations for transition of these industries from the current ‘Perform, \\nAchieve and Trade’ mode to ‘Indian Carbon Market’ mode will be put in \\nplace.    \\nSupport to traditional micro and small industries  \\n78. An investment- grade energy audit of traditional micro and small \\nindustries in 60 clusters, including brass and ceramic, will be facilitated. \\nFinancial support will be provided for shifting them to cleaner forms of \\nenergy and implementation of energy efficiency measures. The scheme will \\nbe replicated in another 100 clusters in the next phase. \\nPriority 7: Infrastructure \\nInfrastructure investment by Central Government \\n79. Significant investment the Central Government has made over the years \\nin building and improving infrastructure has had a strong multiplier effect on the \\neconomy. We will endeavour to maintain strong fiscal support for infrastructure \\nover the next 5 years, in conjunction with imperatives of other priorities and \\nfiscal consolidation. This year, I have provided ` 11,11,111 crore for capital \\nexpenditure. This would be 3.4 per cent of our GDP. \\nInfrastructure investment by state governments \\n80. We will encourage states to provide support of similar scale for \\ninfrastructure, subject to their development priorities. A provision of `  1.5 \\nlakh crore for long -term interest free loans has been made this year also to \\nsupport the states in their resource allocation.  \\nPrivate investment in infrastructure \\n81.  Investment in infrastructure by  private sector will be promoted \\nthrough viability gap funding and enabling policies and regulations. A market-\\nbased financing framework will be brought out.

Bihar has frequently suffered from floods, many of them originating \\noutside the country.  Plans to build flood control structures in Nepal are yet \\nto progress. Our government, through the Accelerated Irrigation Benefit \\nProgramme and other sources, will provide financial support for projects with \\nestimated cost of ` 11,500 crore such as the Kosi -Mechi intra-state link and \\n20 other ongoing and new schemes including barrages, river pollution \\nabatement and irrigation projects.  In addition, survey and investigation of \\nKosi related flood mitigation and irrigation projects will be undertaken.   \\n84. Assam grapples with floods every year by the Brahmaputra River and \\nits tributaries, originating outside India.  We will provide assistance to Assam \\nfor flood management and related projects. \\n85. Himachal Pradesh suffered extensive losses due to floods last year.  \\nOur government will provide assistance to the state for reconstruction and \\nrehabilitation through multilateral development assistance.  \\n86. Uttarakhand too suffered losses due to cloud bursts and massiv e \\nlandslides. We will provide assistance to the state.  \\n87. Recently Sikkim witnessed devastating flash floods and landslides that \\nwreaked havoc across the state.  Our Government will provide assistance to \\nthe state.  \\nTourism \\n88. Tourism has always been a part of our civilization. Our efforts in \\npositioning India as a global tourist destination will also create jobs, stimulate \\ninvestments and unlock economic opportunities for other sectors. In addition \\nto the measures outlined in the interim budget, I propose the following  \\nmeasures.  \\n89.

Rajgir holds immense religious significance for Hindus, Buddhists and \\nJains.  The 20th Tirthankara Munisuvrata templ e in the Jain Temple complex \\nis ancient. The Saptharishi or the 7 hotsprings form a warm water \\nBrahmakund that is sacred. A comprehensive development initiative for \\nRajgir will be undertaken.   \\n91. Our government will support the development  of Nalanda as a tourist \\ncentre besides reviving Nalanda University to its glorious stature.   \\n92. Odisha’s scenic beauty, temples, monuments, craftsmanship, wildlife \\nsanctuaries, natural landscapes and pristine beaches make it an ultimate \\ntourism destination. Our government wi ll provide assistance for their \\ndevelopment. \\nPriority 8: Innovation, Research & Development \\n93. We will operationalize the Anusandhan National Research Fund for \\nbasic research and prototype development. Further, we will set up a \\nmechanism for spurring private sector -driven research and innovation at \\ncommercial scale with a financing pool of `  1 lakh crore in line with the \\nannouncement in the interim budget.  \\nSpace Economy \\n94. With our continued emphasis on expanding the space economy by 5 \\ntimes in the next 10 years , a venture capital fund of ` 1,000 crore will be set \\nup.  \\nPriority 9: Next Generation Reforms \\nEconomic Policy Framework \\n95. We will formulate an Economic Policy Framework  to delineate the \\noverarching approach to economic development and set the scope of the \\nnext generation of reforms for facilitating employment opportunities and \\nsustaining high growth.  \\n96. Our government will initiate and incentivize reforms for (1) improving \\nproductivity of factors of production, and (2) facilitating markets and sectors \\nto become more efficient. These reforms will cover all factors of production, '),\n",

Effective implementation of several of t hese reforms requires \\ncollaboration between the Centre and the states and building consensus, as \\ndevelopment of the country lies in development of the states.  For promoting \\ncompetitive federalism and incentivizing states for faster implementation of \\nreforms, I propose to earmark a significant part of the 50 -year interest-free \\nloan. Working with the states, we will initiate the following reforms.   \\nLand-related reforms by state governments \\n98. Land-related reforms and actions, both in rural and urban areas, will \\ncover (1) land administration, planning and management, and (2) urban \\nplanning, usage and building bylaws. These will be incentivized for \\ncompletion within the next 3 years through appropriate fiscal support.  \\nRural Land related actions \\n99. Rural land related actions will include (1) assignment of Unique Land \\nParcel Identification Number (ULPIN) or Bhu -Aadhaar for all lands, (2) \\ndigitization of cadastral maps, (3) survey of map sub -divisions as per current \\nownership, (4) establishment of land registry, and (5) linking to the  farmers \\nregistry. These actions will also facilitate credit flow and other agricultural \\nservices. \\nUrban Land related actions \\n100. Land records in urban areas will be digitized with GIS mapping. An IT \\nbased system for property record administration, updating, and tax \\nadministration will be established. These will also facilitate improving the \\nfinancial position of urban local bodies.   \\nLabour related reforms \\nServices to Labour \\n101. Our government will facilitate the provision of a wide array of services \\nto labour, including those for employment and skilling. A comprehensive \\nintegration of e-shram portal with other portals will facilitate such one -stop \\nsolution. Open architecture databases for the rapidly changing labour '),\n",

Shram Suvidha and Samadhan portals will be revamped to enhance  \\nease of compliance for  industry and trade.   \\nCapital and entrepreneurship related reforms \\nFinancial sector vision and strategy \\n103. For meeting financing needs of the economy, our government will \\nbring out a financial sector vision and strategy document to prepare the \\nsector in terms of size, capacity and skills. This will set the agenda for the \\nnext 5 years and guide the work o f the government, regulators, financial \\ninstitutions and market participants.   \\nTaxonomy for climate finance  \\n104. We will develop a taxonomy for climate finance for enhancing the \\navailability of capital for climate adaptation and mitigation. This will support \\nachievement of the country’s climate commitments and green transition.  \\nVariable Capital Company structure  \\n105. We will seek the required legislative approval for providing an \\nefficient and flexible mode for financing leasing of aircrafts and ships, and \\npooled funds of private equity through a ‘variable company structure’.       \\nForeign Direct Investment and Overseas Investment \\n106. The rules and regulations for Foreign Direct Investment and Overseas \\nInvestments will be simplified to (1) facilitate foreign direct investments, (2) \\nnudge prioritization, and  (3) promote opportunities for using Indian Rupee as \\na currency for overseas investments.  \\nNPS Vatsalya \\n107.

We have suc cessfully used technology for improving productivity and \\nbridging inequality in our economy during the past 10 years. Public \\ninvestment in digital infrastructure and innovations by the private sector \\nhave helped in improving access of all citizens, particularly the common \\npeople, to market resources, education, health and services.  We will step up \\nadoption of technology towards digitalization of the economy.   \\nEase of Doing Business \\n109. For enhancing ‘Ease of Doing Business’, we are already working on the \\nJan Vishwas Bill 2.0. Further, states will be incentivized for implementation of \\ntheir Business Reforms Action Plans and digitalization. \\nData and Statistics \\n110. For improving data governance, collection, processing and \\nmanagement of data and statistics , different sectoral data bases, including \\nthose established under the Digital India mission, will be utilized with active \\nuse of technology tools.      \\nNew Pension Scheme (NPS)  \\n111. The Committee to review the NPS has made considerable progress in \\nits work. I am happy th at the Staff Side of the National Council of the Joint \\nConsultative Machinery for Central Government Employees have taken a \\nconstructive approach. A solution will be evolved which addresses the \\nrelevant issues while maintaining fiscal prudence to protect the common \\ncitizens. \\nBudget Estimates 2024-25 \\n112. For the year 2024 -25, the total receipts other than borrowings and \\nthe total expenditure are estimated at `  32.07 lakh crore  and ` 48.21 lakh \\ncrore respectively.

The fiscal consolidation path announced by me in 2021 has served our \\neconomy very well, and we aim to reach a deficit below 4.5 per cent next \\nyear. The Government is committed to staying the course. From 2026 -27 \\nonwards, our endeavour will be to keep the fiscal deficit each year such that \\nthe Central Government debt will be on a declining path as percentage of \\nGDP.  \\nI will, now, move to Part B. \\n  '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\budget_speech.pdf', 'page': 25}, page_content=' 22  \\n \\nPART B \\nIndirect Taxes \\n115. I start with GST. It has decreased tax incidence on the common man; \\nreduced compliance burden and logistics cost for trade and industry; and \\nenhanced revenues of the central and state governments. It is a success of \\nvast proportions. To multiply the benefi ts of GST, we will strive to further \\nsimplify and rationalise the tax structure and endeavour to expand it to the \\nremaining sectors. \\n116. My proposals for customs duties intend to support domestic \\nmanufacturing, deepen local value addition, promote export \\ncompetitiveness, and simplify taxation, while keeping the interest of the \\ngeneral public and consumers surmount. \\n117. In Budget 2022- 23, we reduced the number of customs duty rates.  \\nI propose to undertake a comprehensive review of the rate structure over the \\nnext six months to rationalise and simplify it for ease of trade, removal of \\nduty inversion and reduction of disputes. \\n118. I shall now take up sector specific customs duty proposals. \\nMedicines and Medical Equipment \\n119. To provide relief to cancer patients, I propose to fully exempt three \\nmore medicines from customs duties. \\n120. I also propose changes in the BCD on x -ray tubes & flat panel \\ndetectors for use in medical x -ray machines under the Phased Manufacturing \\nProgramme, so as to synchronise them with domestic capacity addition. \\nMobile Phone and Related Parts \\n121. With a three -fold increase in domestic production and almost  \\n100-fold jump in exports of mobile phones over the last six years, the India n \\nmobile phone industry has matured. In the interest of consumers, I now \\npropose to reduce the BCD on mobile phone, mobile PCBA and mobile \\ncharger to 15 per cent. \\n '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\budget_speech.pdf', 'page': 26}, page_content=' 23  \\n \\nCritical Minerals \\n122. Minerals such as lithium, copper, cobalt and rare earth elements are \\ncritical for sectors like nuclear energy, renewable energy, space, defence, \\ntelecommunications, and high- tech electronics. I propose to  fully exempt \\ncustoms duties on 25 critical minerals and reduce BCD on two of them.  This  \\nwill provide a major fillip to the processing and refining of such minerals and \\nhelp secure their availability for these strategic and important sectors.   \\nSolar  Energy  \\n123. Energy transition is critical in the fight against climate change. To \\nsupport energy transition, I propose to expand the  list of exempted capital \\ngoods for use in the manufacture of solar cells and panels in the country. \\nFurther, in view of sufficient domestic manufacturing capacity of solar glass \\nand tinned copper interconnect, I propose not to extend the  exemption of \\ncustoms duties provided to them. \\nMarine products \\n124. India’s seafood exports in the last financial year touched an all- time \\nhigh of more than ₹ 60,000 crore. Frozen shrimp accounted for about  \\ntwo-thirds of these exports. To  enhance their competitiveness, I propose to \\nreduce BCD on certain broodstock, polychaete worms, shrimp and fish feed \\nto 5 per cent. I also propose to exempt customs duty on various inputs for \\nmanufacture of shrimp and fish feed. \\nLeather and Textile  \\n125. Similarly, to enhance the competitiveness o f exports in the leather \\nand textile sectors, I propose to reduce BCD  on real down filling material \\nfrom duck or goose. I am also making additions to the list of exempted goods \\nfor manufacture of leather and textile garments, footwear and other leather \\narticles for export.  \\n126. To  rectify inversion in duty, I propose to reduce BCD, subject to \\nconditions, on methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) for manufacture of \\nspandex yarn from 7.5 to 5 per cent. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\budget_speech.pdf', 'page': 27}, page_content=' 24  \\n \\n127. Furthermore, the export duty structure on raw hides, skins a nd \\nleather is proposed to be simplified and rationalized. \\nPrecious Metals \\n128. To enhance domestic value addition in gold and precious metal \\njewellery in the country, I propose to reduce customs duties on gold and \\nsilver to 6 per cent and that on platinum to 6.4 per cent.  \\nOther Metals \\n129. Steel and copper are important raw materials. To reduce their cost of \\nproduction,  I propose to remove the BCD on ferro  nickel and blister copper. I \\nam also continuing with nil BCD on ferrous scrap and nickel cathode and \\nconcessional BCD of 2.5 per cent on copper scrap. \\nElectronics  \\n130. To increase value addition in the domestic electronics industry,  \\nI propose to remove the BCD, subject to conditions, on oxygen free copper \\nfor manufacture of resistors. I also propose to exempt certain parts for \\nmanufacture of connectors. \\nChemicals and Petrochemicals  \\n131. To support existing and new capacities in the pipeline, I propose to \\nincrease the BCD on ammonium nitrate  from 7.5 to 10 per cent. \\nPlastics \\n132. PVC flex banners are non -biodegradable and hazardous for \\nenvironment and health. To curb their imports, I propose to raise the BCD on \\nthem from 10 to 25 per cent. \\nTelecommunication Equipment \\n133. To incentivise domestic manufacturing, I propose to increase the BCD  \\nfrom 10 to 15 per cent on PCBA of specified telecom equipment.  \\nTrade facilitation \\n134. To promote domestic aviation and boat & ship MRO, I propose to  \\nextend the period for  export of goods imported for repairs from six months \\nto one year. In the same vein, I propose to extend the time-limit for re-import \\nof goods for repairs under warranty from three to five years. \\n '),\n",

We will continue our efforts to simplify taxes, improve tax payer \\nservices, provide tax certainty and reduce litigation while enhancing revenues \\nfor funding the development and welfare schemes of the government. \\n136. It has been our endeavour to simplify taxation. We have taken a \\nnumber of measures in the last few years i ncluding introduction of simplified \\ntax regimes without exemptions and deductions for corporate tax and \\npersonal income tax. This has been appreciated by tax payers. 58 per cent of \\ncorporate tax came from the simplified tax regime in financial year 2022 -23. \\nSimilarly, as per data available till now for the last fiscal, more than two -\\nthirds have availed the new personal income tax regime. \\nComprehensive Review of the Income-tax Act, 1961 \\n137. I am now announcing a comprehensive review of the Income -tax Act, \\n1961. The purpose is to make the Act concise, lucid, easy to read and \\nunderstand. This will reduce disputes and litigation, thereby providing tax \\ncertainty to the tax payers. It will also bring down the demand embroiled in \\nlitigation. It is proposed to be completed in six months. \\n138. A beginning is being made in the Finance Bill by simplifying the tax \\nregime for charities, TDS rate structure, provisions for reassessment and \\nsearch provisions and capital gains taxation. \\nSimplification for Charities and of TDS \\n139. The two tax exemption regimes for charities are proposed to be \\nmerged into one. The 5 per cent TDS rate on many payments is being merged \\ninto the 2 per cent TDS rate and the 20 per cent TDS rate on repurchase  of \\nunits by mutual funds or UTI is being withdrawn. TDS rate on e -commerce \\noperators is proposed to be reduced from one to 0.1 per cent. Moreover, \\ncredit of TCS is proposed to be given in the TDS to be deducted on salary. \\nFurther, I propose to decriminalize delay for payment of TDS up to  the due \\ndate of filing statement for the same. I also plan to provide a standard \\noperating procedure for TDS defaults and simplify and rationalise the \\ncompounding guidelines for such defaults. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\budget_speech.pdf', 'page': 29}, page_content=' 26  \\n \\nSimplification of Reassessment \\n140. I propose to thoroughly simplif y the provisions for reopening and \\nreassessment. An assessment hereinafter can be reopened beyond three \\nyears from the end of the assessment year only if the escaped income is  \\n₹ 50 lakh or more,  up to a maximum period of five years from the end of the \\nassessment year. Even in search cases, a time limit of six years before the \\nyear of search, as against the existing time limit of ten years, is proposed.  \\nThis will reduce tax-uncertainty and disputes. \\nSimplification and Rationalisation of Capital Gains  \\n141. Capital gains taxation is also proposed to be hugely simplified.  \\n142. Short term gains on certain financial assets shall henceforth attract a \\ntax rate of 20 per cent, while that on all other financial assets and all  \\nnon-financial assets shall continue to attract the applicable tax rate. \\n143. Long term gains on all financial and non -financial assets, on the other \\nhand, will attract a tax rate of 12.5 per cent. For the benefit of the lower and \\nmiddle-income classes, I propose to increase the limit of exemption of capital \\ngains on certain financial assets to ₹ 1.25 lakh per year. \\n144. Listed financial assets held for more than a year will be classified as \\nlong term, while unlisted financial assets and all non -financial assets will have \\nto be held for at least two years to be classified as long-term.  \\n145. Unlisted bonds and debentures, debt mutual funds and market linked \\ndebentures, irrespective of holding period, however, will attract tax on \\ncapital gains at applicable rates. \\nTax Payer Services \\n146. All the major tax payer services unde r GST and most services under \\nCustoms and Income Tax have been digitalised. All remaining services of \\nCustoms and Income Tax including rectification and order giving effect to \\nappellate orders shall be digitalized and made paper-less over the next two \\nyears. \\nLitigation and Appeals \\n147. While our concerted efforts to reduce pendency of appeals at various \\nappellate fora are beginning to show good results, it will continue to engage \\nour highest attention. '),\n",

To dispose of the backlog of first appeals, I plan to deploy  more \\nofficers  to hear and decide such appeals, especially those with large tax \\neffect.  \\n149. For resolution of certain income tax disputes pending in appeal, I am \\nalso proposing Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme, 2024.  \\n150. Further, I propose to increase monetary limits for filing appeals \\nrelated to direct taxes, excise and service tax in the Tax Tribunals, High Courts \\nand Supreme Court to ₹  60 lakh, ₹ 2 crore and ₹ 5 crore respectively. \\n151. With a view to reduce litigation and provide certainty in international \\ntaxation, we  will expand the scope of safe harbour rules and make them \\nmore attractive. We will also streamline the transfer pricing assessment \\nprocedure. \\nEmployment and Investment \\n152. I have a few proposals to promote  investment and foster \\nemployment.  \\n153. First of all, to bolster the Indian start- up eco -system, boost the \\nentrepreneurial spirit and support innovation, I propose to abolish the so -\\ncalled angel tax for all classes of investors. \\n154. Second, there is tremendous potential for cruise tourism in India. To \\ngive a fillip to this employment generating industry, I am proposing a simpler \\ntax regime for foreign shipping companies operating domestic cruises in the \\ncountry. \\n155. Third, India is a world leader in the diamond cutting and polishing \\nindustry, which employs a large number of skilled workers. To further \\npromote the development of this sector, we would provide for safe harbour \\nrates for foreign mining companies selling raw diamonds in the country. \\n156. Fourth, to attract foreign capital for our development needs,  \\nI propose to reduce the corporate tax rate on foreign companies from 40 to \\n35 per cent.  \\n \\n '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\budget_speech.pdf', 'page': 31}, page_content=' 28  \\n \\nDeepening the tax base \\n157. I have a couple of proposals for deepening the tax base. First, Security \\nTransactions Tax on futures and options of securities is proposed to be \\nincreased to 0.02 per cent and 0.1 per cent respectively. Second, for reasons \\nof equity, I propose to tax income received on buy back of shares in the \\nhands of the recipient.  \\nOthers \\n158. To improve social security benefits, deduction of expenditure by \\nemployers towards NPS is proposed to be increased from 10 to 14 per cent of \\nthe employee’s salary. Similarly, deduction of this expenditure up to 14 per \\ncent of salary from the income of  employees in private sector, public sector \\nbanks and undertakings, opting for the new tax regime, is proposed to be \\nprovided. \\n159. Indian professionals working in multinationals get ESOPs and invest in \\nsocial security schemes and other movable  assets abroad. Non -reporting of \\nsuch small foreign assets has penal consequences under the Black Money \\nAct. Such non-reporting of movable assets up to ₹ 20 lakh is proposed to be \\nde-penalised. \\n160. Other major proposals in the Finance Bill relate to: \\n• Withdrawal of equalization levy of 2 per cent; \\n• Expansion of tax benefits to certain funds and entities in IFSCs; and \\n• immunity from penalty and prosecution to benamidar on full and \\ntrue disclosure so as to improve conviction under the Benami \\nTransactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988. \\nPersonal Income Tax \\n161. Coming to Personal Income Tax Rates, I have two announcements to \\nmake for those opting for the new tax regime. First, the standard deduction \\nfor salaried employees is proposed to be increased from ₹50,000/- to  \\n₹75,000/-. Similarly, deduction on family pension for pensioners is proposed \\nto be enhanced from ₹  15,000/- to ₹ 25,000/ -. This will provide relief to \\nabout four crore salaried individuals and pensioners. '),\n",

The people of India have reposed their faith in the government led by \\nthe Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and re-elected it for a historic \\nthird term under his leadership. We are grateful for their support, faith and \\ntrust in our policies. We are determined to ensure that all Indians, regardless \\nof religion, caste, gender and age, make substantial progress in realising their \\nlife goals and aspirations. \\nGlobal Context \\n2. The global economy, while performing better than expected, is still in \\nthe grip of policy uncertainties. Elevated asset prices, political uncertainties \\nand shipping disruptions continue to pose significant downside risks for \\ngrowth and upside risks to inflation.  \\n3. In this context, India’s economic growth  continues  to be the shining \\nexception and will remain so in the years ahead. India’s inflation continues to \\nbe low, stable and moving towards the 4 per cent target. Core inflation (non-\\nfood, non -fuel) currently is 3.1 per cent. Steps are being taken to ensure \\nsupplies of perishable goods reach market adequately. '),\n",

As mentioned in the interim budget, we need to focus on 4 major \\ncastes, namely  ‘Garib’ (Poor), ‘Mahilayen’ (Women), ‘Yuva’ (Youth) and  \\n‘Annadata’ (Farmer). For Annadata, we announced higher Minimum Support \\nPrices a month ago for all major crops, delivering on the promise of at least a \\n50 per cent margin over costs. Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana was \\nextended for five years, benefitting more than 80 crore people.  \\n5. Administrative actio ns for approval and implementation of various \\nschemes announced in the interim budget are well underway. The required \\nallocations have been made.   \\nBudget Theme \\n6. Turning attention to the full year and beyond, in this budget, we \\nparticularly focus on employment, skilling, MSMEs, and the middle class. I am \\nhappy to announce the Prime Minister’s package of 5 schemes and initiatives \\nto facilitate employment, skilling and other opportunities for 4.1 crore youth \\nover a 5-year period with a central outlay of ` 2 lakh crore.  I will speak about \\nthem shortly, while more details may be seen in the annexure.  This year, I \\nhave made a provision of ` 1.48 lakh crore for education, employment and \\nskilling.     \\nBudget Priorities \\n7. The people have given a unique opportunity to  our government to \\ntake the country on the path of strong development and all-round prosperity. \\nIn the interim budget, we promised to present a detailed roadmap for our \\npursuit of ‘ Viksit Bharat’. In line with the strategy set out in the interim \\nbudget, this budget envisages sustained efforts on the following 9 priorities \\nfor generating ample opportunities for all.   \\n1) Productivity and resilience in Agriculture \\n2) Employment & Skilling \\n3) Inclusive Human Resource Development and Social Justice \\n4) Manufacturing & Services \\n5) Urban Development    \\n6) Energy Security \\n7) Infrastructure '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\budget_speech.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content=' 3  \\n \\n8) Innovation, Research & Development and \\n9) Next Generation Reforms \\n8. Subsequent budgets will build on these, and add more priorities and \\nactions. A more detailed formulation will be carried out as part  of the \\n‘economic policy framework’ about which I will speak later in this speech.   \\n9. This budget details some of the specific actions to be initiated in the \\ncurrent year towards fulfilment of these priorities with potential for \\ntransformative changes.  The  budget also covers some of the previously \\nmade announcements with an intent to strengthen them and step up their \\nimplementation for expediting our journey towards the goal of Viksit Bharat.   \\nPriority 1: Productivity and resilience in Agriculture \\nTransforming agriculture research \\n10. Our government will undertake a comprehensive review of the \\nagriculture research setup to bring the focus on raising productivity and \\ndeveloping climate resilient varieties.

The scheme will operate o n pooling of credit risks \\nof such MSMEs. A separately constituted self -financing guarantee fund will \\nprovide, to each applicant, guarantee cover up to ` 100 crore, while the loan \\namount may be larger. The borrower will have to provide an upfront \\nguarantee fee and an annual guarantee fee on the reducing loan balance.  \\nNew assessment model for MSME credit \\n44. Public sector banks will build their in -house capabi lity to assess \\nMSMEs for credit, instead of relying on external assessment. They will also \\ntake a lead in developing or getting developed a new credit assessment \\nmodel, based on the scoring of digital footprints of MSMEs in the economy. \\nThis is expected to  be a significant improvement over the traditional \\nassessment of credit eligibility based only on asset or turnover criteria. That \\nwill also cover MSMEs without a formal accounting system. \\nCredit Support to MSMEs during Stress Period \\n45. I am happy to announce  a new mechanism for facilitating \\ncontinuation of bank credit to MSMEs during their stress period.

This will support \\nachievement of the country’s climate commitments and green transition.  \\nVariable Capital Company structure  \\n105. We will seek the required legislative approval for providing an \\nefficient and flexible mode for financing leasing of aircrafts and ships, and \\npooled funds of private equity through a ‘variable company structure’.       \\nForeign Direct Investment and Overseas Investment \\n106. The rules and regulations for Foreign Direct Investment and Overseas \\nInvestments will be simplified to (1) facilitate foreign direct investments, (2) \\nnudge prioritization, and  (3) promote opportunities for using Indian Rupee as \\na currency for overseas investments.  \\nNPS Vatsalya \\n107.

It has decreased tax incidence on the common man; \\nreduced compliance burden and logistics cost for trade and industry; and \\nenhanced revenues of the central and state governments. It is a success of \\nvast proportions. To multiply the benefi ts of GST, we will strive to further \\nsimplify and rationalise the tax structure and endeavour to expand it to the \\nremaining sectors. \\n116. My proposals for customs duties intend to support domestic \\nmanufacturing, deepen local value addition, promote export \\ncompetitiveness, and simplify taxation, while keeping the interest of the \\ngeneral public and consumers surmount. \\n117. In Budget 2022- 23, we reduced the number of customs duty rates.  \\nI propose to undertake a comprehensive review of the rate structure over the \\nnext six months to rationalise and simplify it for ease of trade, removal of \\nduty inversion and reduction of disputes. \\n118. I shall now take up sector specific customs duty proposals. \\nMedicines and Medical Equipment \\n119. To provide relief to cancer patients, I propose to fully exempt three \\nmore medicines from customs duties. \\n120. I also propose changes in the BCD on x -ray tubes & flat panel \\ndetectors for use in medical x -ray machines under the Phased Manufacturing \\nProgramme, so as to synchronise them with domestic capacity addition. \\nMobile Phone and Related Parts \\n121. With a three -fold increase in domestic production and almost  \\n100-fold jump in exports of mobile phones over the last six years, the India n \\nmobile phone industry has matured. In the interest of consumers, I now \\npropose to reduce the BCD on mobile phone, mobile PCBA and mobile \\ncharger to 15 per cent. \\n '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\budget_speech.pdf', 'page': 26}, page_content=' 23  \\n \\nCritical Minerals \\n122. Minerals such as lithium, copper, cobalt and rare earth elements are \\ncritical for sectors like nuclear energy, renewable energy, space, defence, \\ntelecommunications, and high- tech electronics. I propose to  fully exempt \\ncustoms duties on 25 critical minerals and reduce BCD on two of them.  This  \\nwill provide a major fillip to the processing and refining of such minerals and \\nhelp secure their availability for these strategic and important sectors.   \\nSolar  Energy  \\n123. Energy transition is critical in the fight against climate change. To \\nsupport energy transition, I propose to expand the  list of exempted capital \\ngoods for use in the manufacture of solar cells and panels in the country. \\nFurther, in view of sufficient domestic manufacturing capacity of solar glass \\nand tinned copper interconnect, I propose not to extend the  exemption of \\ncustoms duties provided to them. \\nMarine products \\n124. India’s seafood exports in the last financial year touched an all- time \\nhigh of more than ₹ 60,000 crore. Frozen shrimp accounted for about  \\ntwo-thirds of these exports. To  enhance their competitiveness, I propose to \\nreduce BCD on certain broodstock, polychaete worms, shrimp and fish feed \\nto 5 per cent. I also propose to exempt customs duty on various inputs for \\nmanufacture of shrimp and fish feed. \\nLeather and Textile  \\n125. Similarly, to enhance the competitiveness o f exports in the leather \\nand textile sectors, I propose to reduce BCD  on real down filling material \\nfrom duck or goose. I am also making additions to the list of exempted goods \\nfor manufacture of leather and textile garments, footwear and other leather \\narticles for export.  \\n126. To  rectify inversion in duty, I propose to reduce BCD, subject to \\nconditions, on methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) for manufacture of \\nspandex yarn from 7.5 to 5 per cent. '),\n",

Furthermore, the export duty structure on raw hides, skins a nd \\nleather is proposed to be simplified and rationalized. \\nPrecious Metals \\n128. To enhance domestic value addition in gold and precious metal \\njewellery in the country, I propose to reduce customs duties on gold and \\nsilver to 6 per cent and that on platinum to 6.4 per cent.  \\nOther Metals \\n129. Steel and copper are important raw materials. To reduce their cost of \\nproduction,  I propose to remove the BCD on ferro  nickel and blister copper. I \\nam also continuing with nil BCD on ferrous scrap and nickel cathode and \\nconcessional BCD of 2.5 per cent on copper scrap. \\nElectronics  \\n130. To increase value addition in the domestic electronics industry,  \\nI propose to remove the BCD, subject to conditions, on oxygen free copper \\nfor manufacture of resistors. I also propose to exempt certain parts for \\nmanufacture of connectors. \\nChemicals and Petrochemicals  \\n131. To support existing and new capacities in the pipeline, I propose to \\nincrease the BCD on ammonium nitrate  from 7.5 to 10 per cent. \\nPlastics \\n132. PVC flex banners are non -biodegradable and hazardous for \\nenvironment and health. To curb their imports, I propose to raise the BCD on \\nthem from 10 to 25 per cent. \\nTelecommunication Equipment \\n133. To incentivise domestic manufacturing, I propose to increase the BCD  \\nfrom 10 to 15 per cent on PCBA of specified telecom equipment.  \\nTrade facilitation \\n134. To promote domestic aviation and boat & ship MRO, I propose to  \\nextend the period for  export of goods imported for repairs from six months \\nto one year.

We will continue our efforts to simplify taxes, improve tax payer \\nservices, provide tax certainty and reduce litigation while enhancing revenues \\nfor funding the development and welfare schemes of the government. \\n136. It has been our endeavour to simplify taxation. We have taken a \\nnumber of measures in the last few years i ncluding introduction of simplified \\ntax regimes without exemptions and deductions for corporate tax and \\npersonal income tax. This has been appreciated by tax payers. 58 per cent of \\ncorporate tax came from the simplified tax regime in financial year 2022 -23. \\nSimilarly, as per data available till now for the last fiscal, more than two -\\nthirds have availed the new personal income tax regime. \\nComprehensive Review of the Income-tax Act, 1961 \\n137. I am now announcing a comprehensive review of the Income -tax Act, \\n1961. The purpose is to make the Act concise, lucid, easy to read and \\nunderstand. This will reduce disputes and litigation, thereby providing tax \\ncertainty to the tax payers. It will also bring down the demand embroiled in \\nlitigation. It is proposed to be completed in six months. \\n138. A beginning is being made in the Finance Bill by simplifying the tax \\nregime for charities, TDS rate structure, provisions for reassessment and \\nsearch provisions and capital gains taxation. \\nSimplification for Charities and of TDS \\n139. The two tax exemption regimes for charities are proposed to be \\nmerged into one. The 5 per cent TDS rate on many payments is being merged \\ninto the 2 per cent TDS rate and the 20 per cent TDS rate on repurchase  of \\nunits by mutual funds or UTI is being withdrawn. TDS rate on e -commerce \\noperators is proposed to be reduced from one to 0.1 per cent. Moreover, \\ncredit of TCS is proposed to be given in the TDS to be deducted on salary. \\nFurther, I propose to decriminalize delay for payment of TDS up to  the due \\ndate of filing statement for the same. I also plan to provide a standard \\noperating procedure for TDS defaults and simplify and rationalise the \\ncompounding guidelines for such defaults. '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\budget_speech.pdf', 'page': 29}, page_content=' 26  \\n \\nSimplification of Reassessment \\n140. I propose to thoroughly simplif y the provisions for reopening and \\nreassessment. An assessment hereinafter can be reopened beyond three \\nyears from the end of the assessment year only if the escaped income is  \\n₹ 50 lakh or more,  up to a maximum period of five years from the end of the \\nassessment year. Even in search cases, a time limit of six years before the \\nyear of search, as against the existing time limit of ten years, is proposed.  \\nThis will reduce tax-uncertainty and disputes. \\nSimplification and Rationalisation of Capital Gains  \\n141. Capital gains taxation is also proposed to be hugely simplified.  \\n142. Short term gains on certain financial assets shall henceforth attract a \\ntax rate of 20 per cent, while that on all other financial assets and all  \\nnon-financial assets shall continue to attract the applicable tax rate. \\n143. Long term gains on all financial and non -financial assets, on the other \\nhand, will attract a tax rate of 12.5 per cent. For the benefit of the lower and \\nmiddle-income classes, I propose to increase the limit of exemption of capital \\ngains on certain financial assets to ₹ 1.25 lakh per year. \\n144. Listed financial assets held for more than a year will be classified as \\nlong term, while unlisted financial assets and all non -financial assets will have \\nto be held for at least two years to be classified as long-term.  \\n145. Unlisted bonds and debentures, debt mutual funds and market linked \\ndebentures, irrespective of holding period, however, will attract tax on \\ncapital gains at applicable rates. \\nTax Payer Services \\n146. All the major tax payer services unde r GST and most services under \\nCustoms and Income Tax have been digitalised. All remaining services of \\nCustoms and Income Tax including rectification and order giving effect to \\nappellate orders shall be digitalized and made paper-less over the next two \\nyears. \\nLitigation and Appeals \\n147. While our concerted efforts to reduce pendency of appeals at various \\nappellate fora are beginning to show good results, it will continue to engage \\nour highest attention. '),\n",

To dispose of the backlog of first appeals, I plan to deploy  more \\nofficers  to hear and decide such appeals, especially those with large tax \\neffect.  \\n149. For resolution of certain income tax disputes pending in appeal, I am \\nalso proposing Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme, 2024.  \\n150. Further, I propose to increase monetary limits for filing appeals \\nrelated to direct taxes, excise and service tax in the Tax Tribunals, High Courts \\nand Supreme Court to ₹  60 lakh, ₹ 2 crore and ₹ 5 crore respectively. \\n151. With a view to reduce litigation and provide certainty in international \\ntaxation, we  will expand the scope of safe harbour rules and make them \\nmore attractive. We will also streamline the transfer pricing assessment \\nprocedure. \\nEmployment and Investment \\n152. I have a few proposals to promote  investment and foster \\nemployment.  \\n153. First of all, to bolster the Indian start- up eco -system, boost the \\nentrepreneurial spirit and support innovation, I propose to abolish the so -\\ncalled angel tax for all classes of investors. \\n154. Second, there is tremendous potential for cruise tourism in India. To \\ngive a fillip to this employment generating industry, I am proposing a simpler \\ntax regime for foreign shipping companies operating domestic cruises in the \\ncountry. \\n155. Third, India is a world leader in the diamond cutting and polishing \\nindustry, which employs a large number of skilled workers. To further \\npromote the development of this sector, we would provide for safe harbour \\nrates for foreign mining companies selling raw diamonds in the country. \\n156. Fourth, to attract foreign capital for our development needs,  \\nI propose to reduce the corporate tax rate on foreign companies from 40 to \\n35 per cent.  \\n \\n '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\budget_speech.pdf', 'page': 31}, page_content=' 28  \\n \\nDeepening the tax base \\n157. I have a couple of proposals for deepening the tax base. First, Security \\nTransactions Tax on futures and options of securities is proposed to be \\nincreased to 0.02 per cent and 0.1 per cent respectively. Second, for reasons \\nof equity, I propose to tax income received on buy back of shares in the \\nhands of the recipient.  \\nOthers \\n158. To improve social security benefits, deduction of expenditure by \\nemployers towards NPS is proposed to be increased from 10 to 14 per cent of \\nthe employee’s salary. Similarly, deduction of this expenditure up to 14 per \\ncent of salary from the income of  employees in private sector, public sector \\nbanks and undertakings, opting for the new tax regime, is proposed to be \\nprovided. \\n159. Indian professionals working in multinationals get ESOPs and invest in \\nsocial security schemes and other movable  assets abroad. Non -reporting of \\nsuch small foreign assets has penal consequences under the Black Money \\nAct. Such non-reporting of movable assets up to ₹ 20 lakh is proposed to be \\nde-penalised. \\n160. Other major proposals in the Finance Bill relate to: \\n• Withdrawal of equalization levy of 2 per cent; \\n• Expansion of tax benefits to certain funds and entities in IFSCs; and \\n• immunity from penalty and prosecution to benamidar on full and \\ntrue disclosure so as to improve conviction under the Benami \\nTransactions (Prohibition) Act, 1988. \\nPersonal Income Tax \\n161. Coming to Personal Income Tax Rates, I have two announcements to \\nmake for those opting for the new tax regime. First, the standard deduction \\nfor salaried employees is proposed to be increased from ₹50,000/- to  \\n₹75,000/-. Similarly, deduction on family pension for pensioners is proposed \\nto be enhanced from ₹  15,000/- to ₹ 25,000/ -. This will provide relief to \\nabout four crore salaried individuals and pensioners. '),\n",

Subsequent budgets will build on these, and add more priorities and \\nactions. A more detailed formulation will be carried out as part  of the \\n‘economic policy framework’ about which I will speak later in this speech.   \\n9. This budget details some of the specific actions to be initiated in the \\ncurrent year towards fulfilment of these priorities with potential for \\ntransformative changes.  The  budget also covers some of the previously \\nmade announcements with an intent to strengthen them and step up their \\nimplementation for expediting our journey towards the goal of Viksit Bharat.   \\nPriority 1: Productivity and resilience in Agriculture \\nTransforming agriculture research \\n10. Our government will undertake a comprehensive review of the \\nagriculture research setup to bring the focus on raising productivity and \\ndeveloping climate resilient varieties.  Funding will be provided in challenge \\nmode, including to the private sector. Domain experts both from the \\ngovernment and outside will oversee the conduct of such research.   \\nRelease of new varieties \\n11. New 109 high -yielding and climate -resilient varieties of 32 field and \\nhorticulture crops will be released for cultivation by farmers.  \\nNatural Farming \\n12. In the next two years, 1 crore farmers across the country will be \\ninitiated into natural farming supported by certification and branding. \\nImplementation will be through scientific institutions and willing gram \\npanchayats. 10,000 need -based bio -input resource centres will be \\nestablished.   \\nMissions for pulses and oilseeds  \\n13. For achieving self -sufficiency in pulses and oilseeds, we will \\nstrengthen their production, storage and marketing. As announced in the \\ninterim budget, a strategy is being put in place to achieve ‘atmanirbharta’ for \\noil seeds such as mustard, groundnut, sesame, soybean, and sunflower.

Large scale clusters for vegetable production will be developed closer \\nto major consumption centres. We will promote Farmer- Producer \\nOrganizations, cooperatives and start -ups for vegetable  supply chains \\nincluding for collection, storage, and marketing. \\nDigital Public Infrastructure for Agriculture \\n15. Buoyed by the success of the pilot project, our government, in \\npartnership with the states, will facilitate the implementation of the Digital \\nPublic Infrastructure  (DPI) in agriculture for coverage of farmers and their \\nlands in 3 years. During this year, digital crop survey for Kharif using the DPI \\nwill be taken up in 400 districts. The details of 6 crore farmers and their lands \\nwill be brought into the farmer and land registries. Further, the issuance of \\nJan Samarth based Kisan Credit Cards will be enabled in 5 states. \\nShrimp Production & Export \\n16. Financial support for setting up a network of Nucleus Breeding \\nCentres for Shrimp Brood stocks will be pr ovided. Financing for shrimp \\nfarming, processing and export will be facilitated through NABARD.   \\nNational Cooperation Policy \\n17. Our government will bring out a National Cooperation Policy for \\nsystematic, orderly and all- round development of the cooperative s ector. \\nFast-tracking growth of rural economy and generation of employment \\nopportunities on a large scale will be the policy goal. \\n18. This year, I have made a provision of ` 1.52 lakh crore for agriculture \\nand allied sector.     \\nPriority 2: Employment & Skilling \\nEmployment Linked Incentive \\n19. Our government will implement following 3 schemes for ‘Employment \\nLinked Incentive’, as part of the Prime Minister’s package. These will be \\nbased on enrolment in the EPFO, and focus on recognition of first-time \\nemployees, and support to employees and employers.     \\n ')]\n",
